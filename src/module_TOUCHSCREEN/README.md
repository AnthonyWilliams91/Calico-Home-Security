The touchscreen module is a way for the user to 
arm and monitor the security system remotely. It 
is through this application that we can arm/disarm 
the security system as well as add functionality 
such as taking pictures of the intruder and sending 
emails in the event of a breach. 

This application is designed to run on a 7'' Raspberry 
Pi Touchscreen Display such as the one listed here:
